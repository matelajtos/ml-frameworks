# ML framework rating tool

This project's goal is to provide an objective way of comparing [GitHub](https://github.com/) machine learning libraries based on their community size.


### Main goals

  - Collect all of the most important machine learning libraries that are available on GitHub.
  - Calculate a score for each one based on the statistics (stars, watch, forks, contributors).
  - Display them descending order in a visually pleasing manner.
  - Keep track of tendencies and be able to predict future alterations in popularity.
  - Move the project to Microsoft Azure, where score updates would happen on some trigger.
  
Some more that we want to achieve later:
  - Finer scoring system.
  - Grouping by types of ML.
